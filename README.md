Using RStudio to assemble the best NBA team of all time, statistically.


## About This Analysis
Practicing RStudio by determining the best NBA team with statistical measures rather than opinions. Focusing on stats like points, assists and rebounds.

## About The Data
Data pulled from Kaggle, includes data about every basketball player that played in the NBA. Missing stats like blocks, steals, and plus minus ratings. Groups some positions together - point guard and shooting guard are grouped into a single guard category, small forward and power forward are grouped into a single forward category.

## Methods
Ranked players using basic basketball strategy with traditional focuses on each position (e.g picked centers with high rebounds or shooting guards with high point averages).
Used dplyr to clean data, and ggplot2 to visualize data on scatter plots.
